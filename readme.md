# üß™ REST API Testing ‚Äî PetClinic (Postman)

This repository contains the API testing layer (Postman) for the Spring PetClinic REST application. The primary goal is functional validation and automation of backend endpoints using a Postman collection with ordered tests and dynamic data handling.

Quick summary
- Type: Postman collection for integration/functional API tests.
- Technologies: Postman (collection + scripts), JavaScript in Pre-request and Test scripts.
- Requirement: a running instance of the Spring PetClinic REST backend.

## üéØ Testing methodology and core principles

Our approach validates the API contract and data persistence by simulating real user flows and handling dependencies between resources.

1. Data chaining (execution flow)
   - The suite relies on captured variables (for example `createdOwnerId`, `createdPetId`) to maintain the flow: create ‚Üí use ‚Üí update ‚Üí delete.

2. Dynamic data handling and type safety
   - `POST` and `PUT` bodies are generated dynamically in Pre-request Scripts to avoid collisions and allow deterministic checks.
   - Use explicit conversions (e.g. `parseInt`) in assertions when necessary to avoid failures due to `string` vs `number` differences.

3. Order and independence
   - The collection is intended to run sequentially (Postman Runner). Some requests depend on resources created in earlier steps.

## üìå Implemented API endpoints

Only the endpoints validated in the Postman collection are listed below, organized by resource.

### A. Owners (root entity)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| GET | `/api/owners` | Retrieve all pet owners |
| GET | `/api/owners/{ownerId}` | Get a specific pet owner by ID |
| POST | `/api/owners` | Create owner (captures `createdOwnerId`) |
| PUT | `/api/owners/{ownerId}` | Update owner details |
| DELETE | `/api/owners/{ownerId}` | Delete an owner |
| GET | `/api/owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}` | Get a specific pet by ID (hierarchical path) |
| PUT | `/api/owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}` | Update pet details (hierarchical path) |
| POST | `/api/owners/{ownerId}/pets` | Add a new pet for an owner (captures `createdPetId`) |
| POST | `/api/owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}/visits` | Add a vet visit for a pet (hierarchical) |

### B. Pets (flat path)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| GET | `/api/pets` | Retrieve all pets (flat path) |
| GET | `/api/pets/{petId}` | Get a specific pet by ID (flat path) |
| PUT | `/api/pets/{petId}` | Update pet details (flat path) |
| DELETE | `/api/pets/{petId}` | Delete a pet (flat path) |

### C. Visits (transaction entity)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| GET | `/api/visits` | Retrieve all visits |
| GET | `/api/visits/{visitId}` | Get a specific visit by ID |
| POST | `/api/visits` | Create visit (requires `petId` in body; captures `createdVisitId`) |
| PUT | `/api/visits/{visitId}` | Update visit details |
| DELETE | `/api/visits/{visitId}` | Delete a visit |

### D. Vets (veterinarians)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| GET | `/api/vets` | Retrieve all veterinarians |
| GET | `/api/vets/{vetId}` | Get a vet by ID |
| POST | `/api/vets` | Create a new vet (captures `createdVetId`) |
| PUT | `/api/vets/{vetId}` | Update vet details |
| DELETE | `/api/vets/{vetId}` | Delete a vet |

### E. Pet Types (master data)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| GET | `/api/pettypes` | Retrieve all pet types |
| GET | `/api/pettypes/{petTypeId}` | Get a pet type by ID |
| POST | `/api/pettypes` | Add a new pet type (captures `createdPetTypeId`) |
| PUT | `/api/pettypes/{petTypeId}` | Update pet type details |
| DELETE | `/api/pettypes/{petTypeId}` | Delete a pet type |

## üõ†Ô∏è Execution and setup

A running Spring PetClinic REST service is required. Quick options to run it locally:

Windows (using the included wrapper):

```bash
mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

(Use `./mvnw spring-boot:run` on Unix/macOS.)

With Docker (official image):

```bash
docker run -p 9966:9966 springcommunity/spring-petclinic-rest
```

Note: the collection assumes the base path `/petclinic/api` by default (see Postman environment variables).

---

## üöÄ Using the collection in Postman (steps)

1. Import the collection file: `PetClinic_Practice.postman_collection.json`.
2. Create or import an Environment and add the `baseUrl` variable.
   - Example value: `http://localhost:9966/petclinic/api`
3. Ensure the execution order in the Runner respects dependencies (create Owner before Pet, etc.).
4. Run the collection with Postman Runner (sequential mode).

Recommended environment variables

- `baseUrl` ‚Äî API base URL
- `createdOwnerId`, `createdPetId`, `createdVetId`, `createdPetTypeId`, `createdVisitId` ‚Äî chaining variables

## ‚úçÔ∏è Example Pre-request Script (dynamic data)

A snippet to generate unique data before a POST request in Postman:

```javascript
// Generate a unique name and store it in tempFirstName
const randomSuffix = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000);
pm.environment.set('tempFirstName', `TestOwner_${randomSuffix}`);
pm.environment.set('tempLastName', 'API');
// Example: request body = {"firstName": pm.environment.get('tempFirstName'), "lastName": pm.environment.get('tempLastName'), ...}
```

Example of a type-safe assertion in Tests:

```javascript
pm.test('Owner id is numeric and matches expected', function () {
  const body = pm.response.json();
  pm.expect(parseInt(body.id)).to.eql(parseInt(pm.environment.get('createdOwnerId')));
});
```

## ‚úÖ Best practices and recommendations

- Run with Postman Runner in sequential mode to preserve chaining integrity.
- Clear environment variables between runs if you want idempotent tests.
- Add negative tests (4xx responses) to validate error handling.
- Consider parameterizing the collection to run against different databases (H2/HSQLDB/MySQL/Postgres) for deeper integration tests.

## Contributing

If you want to improve the collection or the repository:
1. Fork the repo.
2. Add/edit tests or scripts in the Postman collection.
3. Open a pull request with a clear description of changes.

## License
This project inherits the primary repository license (see `LICENSE.txt`).

If you want, I can:
- Generate a sample `postman_environment.json` with the required variables.
- Add additional Pre-request / Test examples for negative cases or edge scenarios.
- Create an English `README_en.md` file (this file is already in English; I can also produce a Spanish translation if needed).

Tell me which of the options above you want me to add next and I will implement it.
